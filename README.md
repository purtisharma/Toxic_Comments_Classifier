## Project Title -Detecting Toxic Comments using NLP
This project aims to mitigate the negative impacts of online hate comments and fake news within households, with a focus on protecting children who may have limited technology expertise. It specifically addresses three types of online hate comments:

- Community-based
- Religion-based
- Gender-based
The project involved collecting user data from online sources, training and analyzing datasets, and annotating 400,000+ sentences with risk levels (non-risky or risky). Additionally, data pre-processing and the development of a machine learning model to detect risky behavior are key components of the project.

[Toxic Comment Detector App](https://huggingface.co/spaces/PurtiSharma/toxic_comments): The final model is converted into a demo Streamlit app ðŸš€ deployed on Hugging Face Spaces ðŸ¤— for users to test toxic comments. ðŸ’¬
